If you have already installed [haskell stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) then you don't need to do anything else servant will be downloaded automatically.

## Not using stack

If you don't have [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) installed then go and install it.
