# Introduction

## API motivation
Let's Start with a controversial aseveration.

* APIs are fundamental to the business strategy.
* APIs are fundamental for mobile development
* APIs act as contract of what the server will provide and what client will accept
* APIs are fundamental to build architectures using the Microservices pattern

Therefore we can conclude that

> API 1st development is the best.

## Haskell development

Another pair of controversial aseverations.

* Maintenability and Usability are the most important characteristics of a programming language.
* ML languages are very maintenable.

So Haskell is a great programming

## Therefore

* Given that the API is fundamental and
* that haskell help's us develop high-quality software using types
* it makes sense to develop our APIs using it.

Which lead us to haskell servant.

## Benefits
APIs designed with Haskell-Servant

* Cannot receive nor send invalid data
* Are checked in compile time for their coherence
* Don't need to worry about json coding or encoding nor status codes
